## Making your own server
This application is based on a api which sends mails to server using the php `mail()` function.
### 1.Get a hosting
You need to get a hosting with php support and enabled `mail()` function.I have used [000webhost](https://www.000webhost.com) as its free, you can use any. 
### 2.Upload the code
Now upload the `mailr.php` to the server.
### 3.Change mailr_url in mailr.py
after you upload the `mailr.php` copy the link and paste that to your `mailr_url` variable in `mailr.py`
### 4.Done
And you are done setting up your own fake mailling server.
